Compute the full eigenvalue decomposition of the symmetric or hermitian matrix `A`,
such that `A * V = V * D`, where the unitary matrix `V` contains the orthogonal eigenvectors
and the real diagonal matrix `D` contains the associated eigenvalues.

!!! note
    The bang method `eigh_full!` optionally accepts the output structure and
    possibly destroys the input matrix `A`. Always use the return value of the function
    as it may not always be possible to use the provided `DV` as output.
